I designed course material and assignments for the sequential decision making course at Brown. This is the course on Reinforcement Learning at Brown. The course was taught by [Ron Parr](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/) and I was one of two grad TAs in a class of 70 people. The course was well recieved and I personally recieved positive reviewes for my teaching.

Student Testimonial: <i>Saket has domain knowledge far beyond the level of most TAs, which allowed for deep discussion of class material and project insight.</i>

Student Testimonial: <i>Incredibly approachable and easy to talk to. Was a pleasure to go to his hours. The assignments that he wrote were extremely fair and understandable. A+ job </i>
